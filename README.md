## Links



## My process

Built with :

Semantic HTML5 markup

CSS custom properties (variables)

Flexbox

Mobile-first workflow


## What I learned :



This project helped me practice:
```
:root {
  --green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  --grey-800: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
}
```

Using CSS custom properties to make the code more maintainable:
```
img {
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: clamp(25%, 15vw, 30%);
  margin: clamp(10px, 5%, 20px);
}
```

## For future projects, I want to

Improve my design system by setting variables for spacing, font sizes, and border-radius from the start.

Practice using rem vs % more consistently.

Experiment with CSS Grid in addition to Flexbox.
